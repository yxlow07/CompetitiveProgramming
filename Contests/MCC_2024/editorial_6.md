## Problem statement simplified:

Given a binary string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`, for each substring `t` of `s` with length at least 2, we need to:

1. **Transform** `t` exactly `k` times using the specified XOR transformation.
2. **Calculate** the beauty `f(t')` of the transformed string `t'`, where `f(t')` is the number of equal adjacent pairs in `t'`.
3. **Sum** up all `f(t')` values for every valid substring `t` of `s`.
4. **Output** the sum modulo `998244353`.

## Observations:

1. **Transformations**:
   - The transformation is repetitive, allowing it to be computed at once and does not need any intermediatary calculations.
   - If there is a way to calculate the final transformation, denoted as `M`, it would be `M^k` as it is `M` multiplied `k` times

2. **State Changes**:
   - `00` -> `0 0⊕0 0` -> `000`
   - `01` -> `0 0⊕1 1` -> `011`
   - `10` -> `1 1⊕0 0` -> `110`
   - `11` -> `1 1⊕1 1` -> `101`

3. **New pairs of substrings that are formed**:
   - `00` -> `000` -> {(0,0), (0,0)}
   - `01` -> `011` -> {(0,1), (1,1)}
   - `10` -> `110` -> {(1,1), (1,0)}
   - `11` -> `101` -> {(1,0), (0,1)}

4. **Contribution of pairs towards final answer**:
   - there would be `i` substrings ending with the current `i` index
   - there would be `n-i` substrings starting with the current `i` index
   - total contribution score would be `i*(n-i)`

## Solution:

1. **Define transformation matrix, M**:
   Here, each column represents the final state that can be achieved through the operation -> `(0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (1,1)`
   ```
   M = [
      [2 0 0 0],
      [0 1 0 1],
      [0 0 1 1],
      [0 1 1 0]
   ]
   ```

2. **Calculate how each pair affects the final output**:
   - For each `s[i]`, `s[i+1]` -> the substrings that include the pair is `i*(n-i)`
   - Calculate the initial counts of all `00, 01, 10, 11`

3. **Calculate matrix**:
   - Since `0` <= `k` <= `10e18`, it is necessary to use binary exponenetiation to calculate the final matrix result

4. **Final result**: 
   - Multiply `initial * matrix_result mod 998244353` and get the final answer

## Time complexity analysis
1. Initial calculation: 
   - Looping through the array to find the counts of pairs, it is `O(n)`

2. Matrix exponenetiation:
   - Each step, the exponenent `k` is halved, resulting in `O(log k)`
   - Each multiplication requires `4^3` runs to calculate, however it is constant so it is `O(1)`
   - Final: `O(log k)`

3. Overall:
   - `O(n + log k)` which suffices the problem's constraints
